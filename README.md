We are going to develop a software that reads a limited amount of data, 3 or 2 days, and accordingly to this line, polynomial and with high R, we are going to try to predict the short term movement with aid of machine learning. Taking as major factor the sum of all the observations that gives as a result zero or nearly zero. With the aid of machine learning, deep learning and time series we will try to do this task.
